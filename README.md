# Vapor JWT Template

This can totally be used a template if you choose so, but it has everything I need and what most people would need to get everything up and running with Vapor and JWT authentication for an API.
Feel free to submit a PR if anyone has any better solutions for anything I have.

### What has been implemented
- [x] User registration/authentication
- [x] Authorization with the JWT token
- [x] Current user fetching

The JWT token has a lifespan of 5 minutes and is fully signed.

If anyone has any questions, I hang out in the #authentication channel on the Vapor Slack group.
